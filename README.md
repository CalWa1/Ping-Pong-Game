# Ping-Pong-Game
## This project was made using this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IebKxsucu-s) as well as this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XUT0Y1maAFU), I also added a bit of code to randomise the starting position of the ball

There is currently an issue in which the ball can glitch inside of the racket causing the points to skyrocket very quickly. The ball can also start moving too fast to the point where it starts to glitch out.
